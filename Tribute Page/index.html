            <h2>About Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj</h2>
            <p>
                Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, born on February 19, 1630, in Shivneri Fort, Maharashtra, was the son of
                Shahaji Bhosale and Jijabai. Raised in constant conflict, he was instilled with leadership skills and a
                sense of justice from a young age. At the age of 16, he captured his first fort, Torna, and soon began
                expanding his territory. By 1647, he had taken control of Poona, marking the beginning of his quest to
                establish the Maratha Empire. Known for his innovative military tactics, particularly guerrilla warfare,
                Shivaji captured several key forts, including Raigad, Sinhagad, and Purandhara, and expanded his
                influence across western India. In 1674, he was crowned Chhatrapati at Raigad Fort, solidifying his
                authority.
                Throughout his reign, he fought numerous battles against the Mughal Empire, including the Battle of
                Sinhagad and the defence of his kingdom. Shivaji Maharaj passed away on April 3, 1680, likely due to
                illness, but his legacy endured through his successors and continued to inspire Maratha's resistance
                against foreign powers. He is remembered as a visionary leader, a just ruler, and a symbol of bravery
                and independence.
